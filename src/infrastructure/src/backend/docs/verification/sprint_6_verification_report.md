## Issues and Recommendations

### Critical Issues

**NONE** - No critical issues blocking deployment.

### Minor Issues (Non-blocking)

1. **Import Path Inconsistencies** (2 files)
   - Impact: Low (both work, just inconsistent)
   - Recommendation: Standardize on single import alias

2. **Hardcoded Chart Colors** (1 file)
   - Impact: Low (works correctly, just harder to theme)
   - Recommendation: Extract to theme constants

3. **Duplicate Mappings** (3 files)
   - Impact: Low (DRY principle violation)
   - Recommendation: Extract to shared constants

4. **CDK Deprecation Warnings**
   - Impact: Low (still functional)
   - Recommendation: Update S3Origin to S3BucketOrigin
