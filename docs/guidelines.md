Implementation Guidelines for AI Development
Critical Path Dependencies
The following tasks are on the critical path and must be completed in order:

Task 1.1 → 1.2 → 1.4 → 2.2 → 2.3 (Foundation)
Task 2.1 → 2.4 → 2.5 (Authentication)
Task 3.1 → 3.2 (Content CRUD)
Task 5.1 → 5.2 (Search)
Task 1.5 → 5.3 (Frontend deployment)

For Each Task:

Start with the test file - Write comprehensive tests BEFORE implementation
Reference the ADRs - Every implementation should follow the architecture decisions
Use the acceptance criteria as a checklist - Don't mark complete until all items are checked
Document edge cases discovered during implementation
Update the API documentation as endpoints are created
Commit message format: [Task X.Y] Brief description of change

Testing Strategy by Sprint:

Sprint 1-2: Focus on unit tests and infrastructure tests
Sprint 3-4: Add integration tests for APIs
Sprint 5-6: Include component tests for UI
Sprint 7-8: Complete E2E test suite

 Tests pass with >80% coverage
 No hardcoded values (use environment variables)
 Error handling implemented
 Logging added for debugging
 Performance considerations addressed
