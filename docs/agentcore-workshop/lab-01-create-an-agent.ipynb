    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this first lab, we'll build a Customer Service Assistant prototype that will evolve throughout the workshop into a production-ready system serving multiple customers with persistent memory, shared tools, and full observability. Our agent will have the following three core tools available:\n",
    "- **get_return_policy()** - Get return policy information from dedicated knowledge base\n",
    "- **get_product_info()** - Get product specifications from dedicated knowledge base\n",
    "- **track_order()** - Track order status using various identifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "**Workshop Journey:**\n",
    "- **Lab 1 (Current)**: Create Agent Prototype - Build a functional Customer Service Assistant\n",
    "- **Lab 2**: Enhance with Memory - Add conversation context and personalization\n",
    "- **Lab 3**: Scale with Gateway & Identity - Share tools across agents securely\n",
    "- **Lab 4**: Deploy to Production - Use AgentCore Runtime with observability\n",
    "- **Lab 5**: Build User Interface - Create a customer-facing application\n",

    "- **Tools reusability** - tools aren't reusable across different agents  \n",
    "- **Running locally only** - not scalable\n",
    "- **Identity** - No user and/or agent identity or access control\n",
    "- **Observability** - Limited observability into agent behavior\n",
    "- **Existing APIs** - No access to existing enterprise APIs for customer data\n",
