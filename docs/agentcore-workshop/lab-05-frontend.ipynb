    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In Labs 1-4, we built a production-ready Customer Support Agent with memory, shared tools, and runtime deployment. Now we'll create a user-friendly Streamlit web application for customers to interact with our agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Workshop Journey:**\n",
    "- **Labs 1-4 (Done)**: Agent prototype → Memory → Gateway & Identity → Production Runtime\n",
    "- **Lab 5 (Current)**: Build customer-facing UI\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Features:**\n",
    "- Secure authentication via Amazon Cognito\n",
    "- Real-time streaming chat interface\n",
    "- Session management with persistent memory\n",
    "- Performance metrics display\n",
