Excellent, thank you. I need you to fix all the problems, gaps and shortcomings you identified. Your goal must be to deliver 100% completion of every aspect of the project, ensuring all acceptance criteria are met and all tests pass. Do not implement or fix anything that's beyond the scope of the project. Analyze the root cause of every problem and consider multiple alternatives before attempting a fix or an implementation, and always validate and verify it, making sure it adheres to our requirements and it follows the specified best practices. ultrathink in order to understand everything better. It's not ok to postpone things you've identified are part of the scope of the project, or to leave technical debt. Also, we don't need to solve things that are not in the project scope.
We need all tests to pass, if a test is failing that means either the functionality is broken or the way we're testing it is broken. we need to make sure test failures mean broken features, and if that is the case we obviously need to fix the features.
