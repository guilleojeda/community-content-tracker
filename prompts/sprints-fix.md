Excellent, thank you. I need you to fix all the problems, gaps and shortcomings you identified. Your goal must be to deliver 100% completion of the current sprint, ensuring all acceptance criteria are met and all tests pass. Do not implement or fix anything that's beyond the current sprint, let's focus on the current sprint. Analyze the root cause of every problem and consider multiple alternatives before attempting a fix or an implementation, and always validate and verify it, making sure it adheres to our requirements and it follows the specified best practices. ultrathink in order to understand everything better. It's not ok to postpone things from the current sprint, or to leave technical debt. Also, we don't need to solve things from future sprints, only for the current sprint.
